          <h2>Fact About Dogs</h2>
          <p>
            Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of
            time. Unlike humans, dogs don’t have the ability to create actual
            measures of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t
            know how to read clocks. So, telling them ”I’ll be back in 15
            minutes” won’t really do much, but we understand that you feel like
            you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on
            past events, and can be taught to anticipate future events based on
            past experiences. Pavlov’s dogs are the perfect example of this.

            The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the
            domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the
            modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were the
            first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000
            years ago before the development of agriculture.
